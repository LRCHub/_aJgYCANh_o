Here we go
There once was a time and there once was a way
We had something goin' then to my dismay
Attention to me seemed to drift though I don't know where
And when we're alone seems there's nothing to say
I bring up the topic, you push it away
You say that you do but I think it's just you don't care
Why do I feel you're using me?

Are we an item or are we just two?
I need some commitment s'all I ask of you
Your lifestyle can change
Don't be afraid what you think's in store
I know what's on your mind you've got lots to lose
Your shallow acquaintances what's there to choose
You won't get too deep even though I'm worth so much more
So think about it carefully

Smile for the while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times, while we can

Go!
Rock
Do you want to hustle?
Freak
That's right!
Rock
Do you want to salsa?
Freak
That's right!
Rock
Do you want to hustle?
Freak
That's right!
Do you want to salsa?

If that's how you want it that's how it'll be
There's no use in trying nor making you see
That love don't come easy you don't know what it's about
To get things together won't take any pain
Don't need to see, hear from you never again
From this day on lesson learned no more games count me out
And you know what I talk about

Smile for the while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share
The good times while we can

I know now's the time that I went to find something new
You know it's your crime that I'm out to find someone too
