Here we go

There once was a time and there once was a way
We had something going, and to my dismay
Attention to me seemed to drift
Though I don't know where
And when we're alone seems there's nothing to say
I bring up a topic; you push it away
You say that you do but I think it's just you don't care
Why do I feel you're using me

Are we an item or are we just two?
I need some commitment; it's all I ask of you
Your lifestyle can change
Don't be 'fraid what you think's in store

I know what's on your mind
You've got lots to lose
Your shallow acquaintance
Is what's there to choose
You won't get too deep
Even though I'm worth so much more
So think about it carefully

(Smile for a while and let's be jolly)
(Love shouldn't be so melancholy)
(Come along and share the good times)
(While we can)

(Yeah, rock)
(Do you want to hustle?)
(Freak)
(That's right)
(Rock)
(Do you want to salsa?)
(Freak)
(That's right)
(Rock)
(Do you want to hustle?)
(Freak)
(That's right)
(Rock)
(Do you want to salsa?)

If that's how you want it
That's how it'll be
There's no use in trying
Or making you see
That love don't come easy
You don't know what it's about

To get things together
Won't take any pain
Don't need to see, hear from you
Never again
From this day on, listen, but no more
Please count me out
And you know what I'm talkin' 'bout

(Smile for a while and let's be jolly)
(Love shouldn't be so melancholy)
(Come along and share the good times)
(While we can)

I know now's the time that I went to find something new

You know it's your crime that I'm out to find someone, too
